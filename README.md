# Text Summarization

The Pandemic has changed the education sector; it has pushed optimization in 
delivery methods. Schools and education institutions have been forced to move online. A 
new normal has been created and it is teaching online. Due to the virtual platform every 
study material is also being uploaded as a text or PDF file. The text in the file contains a 
huge amount of information and data. Whenever students study the entire notes provided 
by teachers they short list some keypoints and make their own notes which will be simpler 
and easy to understand. Also, once the user has watched the educational notes, next time he 
may not want to go through the entire notes as he has already watched it and reading the 
main points may be sufficient for him to revise the topic from that notes. 
The system automates the manual process of summarizing the short notes from the 
huge amount of notes. System's primary goal is to take notes from lecture notes. These 
notes contain a summarised version of the text that appears in the lecture notes. This used 
to make it easier to find content with crucial points. However, In the case of text notes, 
reviewing the essential points may be sufficient for the user to review the entire topic. This 
technology has a lot of potential in the educational field

Concept

 

Information isn't worth much if it doesn't serve a purpose. MIS students learn how
businesses use the information to improve the company's operations. Students also
learn how to manage various information systems so that they best serve the needs
of managers, staff and customers. MIS students learn how to create systems for
finding and storing data, and they learn about computer databases, networks,
computer security, and lots more. The component of an information system includes:
a hardware which is used for input/output process and storage of data, software used
to process data and also to instruct the hand-ware component, databases which is
the location in the system where all the organization data will be automated and
procedures which is a set of documents that explain the structure of that
management information system.

Concept

 

There are various driving factors of management information system for example-
Technological revolutions in all sectors make new managers need to have access to

a large amount of particular information for the complex tasks and decisions.The
lifespan of most product has continued getting shorter and shorter, and therefore

the challenge to the manager is to design product that will take a longer shelf life,and
in order to do this, the manager must be able to keep abreast of the factors that
influence the organization product and services thus, management information system
comes in handy in supporting the process.
